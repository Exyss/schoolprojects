Thanks for cheking out my first "serious" java school project!

This project consists in a java program which helps you manage an interactive to-do list.
The list is made out of activities, which can be added, removed or edited and, most of all, marked as completed.

When an scheduled deadline of an activity which wasn't already completed is expiring in ten minutes,
a reminder will be sent to the user (works only on Windows).

In addition, you can look at a list of all the days that contain at least one activity.
Every information relative to the days shown by the list will be also included in it.
